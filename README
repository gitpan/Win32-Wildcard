Win32-Wildcard version 0.01
===========================

This is the README file for the Win32::Wildcard module.
This module provides a straight-forward interface for processing the wildcards
used in Win32 command line. The standard File::DosGlob module maked my work
minimal.

The unfold function globs the pattern appeared in @ARGV and assign the final
file list back to @ARGV. Every element of @ARGV is treated as single pattern
and white spaces are reserved.

I think the beauty of this stuff is just its simplicity. There is only one
sub with no arguments and no return values.
